					<p class="margin-b-50">I am a driven entrepreneur and a lifelong student who is incredibly passionate about technology that disrupts. I most recently graduated from the University of Illinois @ Urbana-Champaign with my Masters in Computer Science, where I spent my time in a variety of studies from A.I. to User Interface Design. Prior to that I studied at the University of Dayton where I received my Bachelor’s in Computer Science. My time at Dayton was filled with 6 internships ranging from Venture Capital to AR/VR, 3 Startups and many interesting side projects. </p>

					<p class="margin-b-50">My technology skills include, but are not limited to, mobile development natively with Swift and Kotlin as well as cross-platform with React-Native, web development with React, Node, Rails and more, machine learning with Python, blockchain development on Ethereum and UX design with Sketch. </p>


					<p class="margin-b-50">
					I aspire to learn through my experiences, enhance and refine the skills I gain along the way, and positively impact the world around me. My skills best align with the intersection between technology and business, meaning being able to develop an idea, create a go to market strategy and then raise funds. </p>

						<p class="font-semi-white margin-tb-30">Thus far, my time at Wavemaker Labs has been spent learning and developing in the world of robotics. With the structure of Wavemaker Labs being unique, I was able to work on a variety of different projects ranging starting and building a robotics freelance company to building and autonomous commercial lawnmower. The companies were started via equity crowdfunding, so I was able to get experience with structuring and maintaining an equity round as well as building a data collection portal for our own internal analytics. The part I enjoy most about Wavemaker is the wide breadth of skills I have been able to develop. Skills like Docker, Semantic Segmentation, training and deploying Neural Nets, developing a full coverage path planner, are examples of skills I have had to master on the job in order to complete different tasks. </p>

Littlelines was my first experience that I got to see the full cycle of a project - starting from initial meetings, to design to development and then the finished product.

							<h4><b>MIKE POSNER APP</b></h4>
							<h6 class="margin-t-10">SPRING 2019</h6>
							<p class="margin-tb-30">It all began when I reached out to Mike via instagram and offered my services as he planned for his walk across the country. After getting his attention we hopped on an intro call and began brainstorming ideas to track him across the country. The idea was that people would join him along his route and walk with him. With this in mind I began to explore technologies that would make this possible. After taking everything into account I landed on building a mobile app specifically for Mike that would get his location of his iPhone and send it to a firebase server, where I would build a custom interface on his website as well as a client side mobile application that people could track him on as well.</p>

							<img src="images/posner.png" alt="">

							<p class="margin-tb-30">The app in theory worked well and accomplished everything needed. However in practice it resulted in too many people walking with him causing dangerous situations on the road and ultimately taking away focus from the walk. In which case we decided to take the app down but left the route on his website so people could still follow him and his journey.</p>

							<h4><b>BEACONATOR APP</b></h4>
							<h5 class="font-yellow"><b>FUSIONARY</b> - GRAND RAPIDS, MI</h5>
							<h6 class="margin-t-10">SUMMER 2015</h6>
							<a href="https://github.com/garrettogrady/BeaconApp" target="_blank">Github Link</a>
							<p class="margin-tb-30">This was an app I built for Fusionary during my internship there in the summer of 2015. They had a client approach them about a way to track which employees came to meetings and when they arrived at the office and left at night. It seemed a bit big-brother ish to me but nonetheless a sweet app! I got to work playing with the Estimote SDK for iBeacons since we have 6 iBeacons.</p>
							<h4><b>Step One - Getting the iBeacons to talk to the iPhones</b></h4>
							<p class="margin-tb-30">The first step was to make an app that could talk to the beacons. I used the SDK and made a push notification every time someone entered the beacon ranging area.</p>
							<img src="images/beaconator/goal.png" alt="">
							<h4><b>Step Two - Sending the data somewhere</b></h4>
							<p class="margin-tb-30">Next I wanted to send that data somewhere so I created a slack channel in the office and sent the requests there. It was my first time dealing with JSON in swift and I got to learn how to use Cocoapods.</p>

							<h4><b>Step Three: Creating a web app</b></h4>
							<p class="margin-tb-30">With the help of one of the senior JS developers, we created a Node.JS application that functioned as the backend API for the app. It not only received the data of where people were in the office but the front end of the application pulled the data from it as well in to a table.</p>
							<img src="images/beaconator/api.png" alt="">
							<p></p>
							<h4 class="margin-tb-30"><b>Step Four: Creating the front end of the app</b></h4>
							<p class="margin-tb-30">With data being pulled from the API I was free to start making the frontend. I created a table view that pulled each users location and displayed where they were in the office. I then added segues to get more information on people and see where they had been. The third set of segues led to clicking on a room and seeing who was currently there and who had been there.</p>

							<h5 class="font-yellow"><b>UNIVERSITY OF DAYTON</b> - DAYTON, OH</h5>
							<h6 class="margin-t-10">SPRING 2016</h6>
							<p class="margin-tb-30">What started as a final project for an Internet of Things class, turned in to a proposal for implementing an environmental sensor network. After an investment from the Hanley Sustainability Institute, a team consisting of myself a 3 other Computer Science students, were able to begin implementing an environmental sensor network for the Mission of Mary Urban Farm.</p>	
							<p class="margin-tb-30">Along with the sensor network came an app I built in swift to pull the JSON from the server and parse it to display the current air and soil temperatures inside the greenhouses. This allowed the farmers to easily monitor the greenhouse conditions. Push notifications were also set up to alert the farmers of any extreme changes to the greenhouse that required immediate attention.</p>
